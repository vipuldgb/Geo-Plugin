# Geo-Plugin

This plugin provides engineers and architects with powerful tools to efficiently calculate key structural loads for slabs and supports in BricsCAD. The suite includes several commands designed to help professionals quickly assess and compute design loads based on user inputs. With this plugin, you can streamline your design process by getting accurate load calculations directly within BricsCAD.

Key Features:
BOM Export (Block Count Export):

This tool allows users to generate a detailed Bill of Materials (BOM) in CSV format. Select an area within your drawing, and the plugin will count unique block instances within that area, removing duplicates and exporting the block names and their respective counts. The generated CSV can be used for documentation or further analysis.
Leg Load Calculation:

With the Leg Load Calculation tool, engineers can easily compute the load on structural legs based on horizontal and vertical distances between specified points. The tool calculates the total leg load considering the design load in pounds per square foot (psf). This is crucial for structural analysis and ensuring that your design meets the required load-bearing capacity.
Slab Design Load Calculation:

The Slab Design Load tool is designed to help users calculate the total design load on a slab based on its thickness, the unit weight of concrete, and a predefined live load. The plugin computes the total load in pounds per square foot (psf), allowing you to quickly determine the slab's load requirements for structural analysis.
How to Use:
BOM Export: Simply select the area in the drawing where you want to count blocks, and the plugin will generate a CSV file with the block counts.
Leg Load Calculation: Select the midpoints of the left, right, top, and bottom sides of the leg or support, and input the design load. The plugin will return the calculated leg load.
Slab Design Load: Input the slab thickness in feet, and the plugin will compute the slab's total design load using predefined values for concrete weight and live load.
Benefits:
Save time by automating complex calculations directly within BricsCAD.
Improve accuracy and efficiency in generating structural load data.
Generate CSV reports for easy documentation and sharing.
Simple and intuitive user interface for fast, hassle-free usage.
